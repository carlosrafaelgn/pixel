# Pixel Maze

My son is still into maze games nowadays (September 2020). So... As I needed to put WebAssembly and WebGL2 into practice, I decided to continue the game I created for him in 2019! Cucumbers must be collected in some levels because he enjoys a certain cucumber from a famous cartoon! By the way, he created Level 1 on his own üòÅ
